   <p><pre>Paramvah Studios aims to be a world class production house creating memorable films & characters using <pre>latest technologies & best creative talents. We are a production house, engaged in creating movie content and<pre> Paramvah Studios is more than just a name for us.</pre></pre></pre></p><br>

    <p><pre>Paramvah means the first vibration. According to a legend, the Paramvah came through Shiva's damroo, which<pre>was Om and he started dancing to the tune when the universe was formed. The music and Shiva's dance is a <pre>form of entertainment, which nobody has seen. The whole idea of keeping the name Paramvah is do something<pre> out-of-the-box.</pre></pre></pre></p>
    
    <p><pre>It encompasses the essence of our imagination, creativity and perseverance, which takes us closer to every<pre> creative person who can work with a creative space and with complete freedom.</pre></p>
    
    <p><pre>For some it is projects and for few assignments, they also call it dreams; for us it is passion! It is the passion<pre> that differentiates us from others. We are just a year old but inching towards completion of our first project<pre> that serves as platform to many debutants (people in front of the camera and behind the camera).</pre></pre></p>
